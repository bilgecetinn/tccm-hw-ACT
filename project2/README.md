# Sparse Matrix Multiplication in Fortran

The objectives of this project are:
- Reading sparse matrices from text files
- Converting sparse matrices to dense format
- Multiplying sparse-sparse and dense-dense matrices
- Measuring performance of multiplication methods
- Analyzes the scaling behavior of multiplication with respect to matrix size and filling degree
- Timing and proling data for each multiplication method
- Observations on scaling behavior with matrix size and filling degree
  
## Files and documents
- `src/`: Contains source code
- `tests/`: All the test programs

## Requirements
- Fortran Compiler (e.g., `gfortran`)
- BLAS
